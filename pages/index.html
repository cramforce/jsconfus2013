			<h2>Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort</h2>
			<p>The <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/AmeliaIsland.aspx">Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort</a> will be the home to the JSConf 5<sup>th</sup> year family reunion and is the perfect setting for an amazing time. Far more secluded than any previous JSConf, the resort has everything you might want and need to do all within walking (or segway, if you prefer) distance. Whether you fancy a geek golf tournament, bonfires on the beach, or just a little <a href="http://www.nodecopter.com">NodeCopter</a> hackathon - there is something for everyone at the Resort.</p>
			<p>The dates for this event line up perfectly with the Memorial Day US holiday (May 27<sup>th</sup>) and we encourage you to bring your family with you. The resort is a <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/AmeliaIsland/ResortActivities.aspx">perfect family (or individual) vacation</a> before/after/during the conference as the water and weather will be warm! Also bear in mind that many other JS developers will probably also be extending their stay, so you can have a full week of JSConf awesomeness!</p>

		<h2>Amelia Island, Florida</h2>
		<p>Nestled in Florida, just south of Georgia, the barrier island of Amelia Island is an absolute paradise, in part because it is remote location. The closest airport is <a href="http://www.jia.aero/">Jacksonville International Airport (JAX)</a>, roughly 29 miles from the resort. We, JSConf, will be providing transportation between the airport and the resort on May 28<sup>th</sup> and June 1<sup>st</sup>, details to come shortly. If you opt to rent a car OR drive to Amelia Island, there is plenty of free parking on the resort If you do bring a car, you can head to the historic and beautiful <a href="http://www.ameliaisland.com/">Fernandina Beach</a>. There will be shuttles to Fernandina as well, but only on a limited, pre-arranged basis.</p>

	<h1>Speakers</h1>
	<p>As part of our on-going <a href="/a-jsconf-reflection">reinvention of JSConf</a>, we are going to break our <a href="http://www.voodootikigod.com/how-i-pick-speakers-for-jsconf">single, most sacred rule</a>, if you have spoken at a JSConf, it is nearly impossible to speak again at a JSConf. Over the past four years of JSConf events, we have spotlighted individuals that would otherwise never get a stage. We have given a platform for risky, crazy, and amazing things to flourish into even bigger, more widely-known products, ideas, and libraries. Many of the brightest things in JS over the last five years have their roots deeply engrained with JSConf and this is something we take incredible pride in. We push ourselves each year to take riskier and riskier speakers because they define the discussion about JS over the next year or years. If you want to speak at JSConf OR if you want to help decide who will speak at JSConf, please check our <a href="/call-for-speakers">call for speakers</a> for all the details.</p>

		<p>We have been doing JSConf for 5 years with 10 events across the world and every single one has been better than the previous, it is something we take a great deal of pride in. We make events that aren't from the standard conference playbook, because we believe you deserve more than that. We have always retained some core concepts, the most fundamental of which is to always focus on the human social development aspect of the event. The second is to always indulge every attendee well beyond that which they have paid. The third is to always treat attendees, staff, sponsors, and speakers with the utmost of respect and appreciation. We have been a launching point for an incredible number of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web.</p>
		<p>The JSConf team is constantly working to make the best technology event possible, which means not just creating events, but embracing a mission. Whether it is actively working to <a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html">fix the diversity in</a> <a href="http://news.jsconf.com/the-community-that-cares">computing issue</a>, <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamJS">help feed the hungry</a>, or try to <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2011/an_end_to_negativity.html">fix the rampant negativity in our community</a>, we are deeply dedicated making our (and your) world a better place. We want you to be part of it, we want you to be part of <a href="http://jsconf.com">the JSConf family</a> and help us with our mission.</p>

	<h2>Why is it called the 5<sup>th</sup> year reunion?</h2>
	<div class='clearfix'>
		<img src='/img/history.jpg' alt='pictures from the historical record of JSConf US' class='left' />
		<p>Maybe this is your first year, maybe it is your fifth - either way if you are at JSConf, you are family! It is rare for a crazy social experiment like JSConf to last for 5 whole years and still be growing, changing, and making things better. But here we are! This year, we are revamping the entire conference model. The event will have four discrete tracks over two days (Wednesday and Friday) with an intermission day in-between (Thursday). The tracks are broken down as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Track A</b> - An organizer curated track with <a href="http://www.voodootikigod.com/jsconf-us-2013-call-for-speakers">competing alumni versus new speakers</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Track B</b> - A "first-come, first-served" track similar to an un-conference style where attendees are provided the chance to speak on any topic of their choice. Talking slots will be similar in length to the Track A (roughly 30 minutes). These speaking slots will open up to attendees right before the event.</li>
			<li><b>Training Track</b> - A dedicated track to educational aspects of JS in all facets.</li>
			<li><b>Significant Others Track</b> - A planned track for significant others of attendees that are interested in something other than JS. We are strongly encouraging attendees to bring their close family because people are more than just islands and we want that well represented.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A quick note on our new model. We are focusing on intimate small group discussions while simultaneously supporting a broader range of attendees. In order to do this, we are recreating our traditional "big parties" into family style dinners. The intermission day (Thursday) will be a break out to allow people to relax and make connections without the worry of "missing something amazing" during the conference. We are providing these small events as opportunities for amazing networking opportunities that are otherwise unheard of at technology events. </p>
